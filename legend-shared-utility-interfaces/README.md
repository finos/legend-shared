# Overview

This module is intended to be a collection of utility interfaces/classes to be widely used across Legend repos.

Candidates for inclusion in this module include :
* Annotations such as "@ExperimentalApi"
* Test interfaces to be used with Junit Categories

# Dependencies 

Since we intend to use this module widely across Legend, this module should not bring in too many (or any ?) library dependencies.
